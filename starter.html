    <p class="one">To make a responsive bootstrap grid you must have a container named row and in that container it will hold columns. In the columns area you can make changes to 5 different web sizes: Extra Small, Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. One row in bootstrap can only hold 12 columns so when you are calculating how much columns you want per row the total must equal 12. For instance if i had 3 columns and wanted all of them in one row I would give each column 4. Example: col-sm-4 col-sm-4 col-sm-4 (col = column sm=small/webpage size and 4 is the value). The three columns multiplied by the number 4 equals 12 total. Meaning the three columns will be displayed evenly on one row. If you want the columns to have their own row you would give them each value of 12 and since 12 is one whole row size they will all be on top of each other. This is the basics of bootstrap. If you want it on one row make sure they all equal to 12, if you want each of then in their own row you would give them the whole value of 12, and if you want maybe 2 on 1 row and the other one under give the 2 values of 6 which equal 12 and then the last one a value of 12 etc. </p>
